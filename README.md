## Project Summary

A hypothetical superstore is planning a year-end sale, where they will offer a gold membership to existing customers. Superstore management wants to understand which factors affect a customer's response to the membership offer, based on which customers accepted the offer in the last campaign.

## Process
<b>Data Source:</b> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/superstore-marketing-campaign-dataset">Superstore Marketing Campaign Dataset</a> (Kaggle)<br>
 <br>
<b>Data Cleanup & Preparation:</b><br>
	• In the <em>Marital Status</em> column, I updated "YOLO", "Alone", and "Absurd" to "Single".<br>
• I created an <em>Age</em> column and calculated the age of each customer by subtracting the value in the <em>Year_Birth</em> column from 2023.
